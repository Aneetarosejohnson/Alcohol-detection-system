Problem statement:   Develop a microcontroller based prototype which can detect the drunk and drive issue of driver by detecting the consumption of alcohol by the driver.
Scope of solution:   Reduces the risk of accidents caused by drunk driving.
Required Components: 
                     IDE: Tinkercad
                     Arduino Uno R3
                     Red LED
                     220 Ω Resistor
                     220 Ω Resistor
                     Gas Sensor (Selected based on availability, for real world applications can use MQ-3 alcohol sensor)
                     Piezo buzzer

Code for the solution:

int S = 0;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(A5, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
 }

void loop()
{
  S = analogRead(A5);
 
  if (S>30) 
  {
      digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
      tone(7, 220, 100);
      delay(200);
  }
  else
  {
    digitalWrite(13,LOW);
  }
}
